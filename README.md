## Overview
I completed this project for a machine learning class. My class had a private competition hosted on Kaggle to build the most accurate model classifying images of tulips, sunflowers, daisies, dandelions, and roses. I do not have access to the image labels for the test data set, as these were hidden for competition integrity. 

The repository includes the image data, the saved model, and a notebook with my code and model description. I wanted to practice CNN concepts without the help from pretrained image recognition models as many of my classmates used. The saved model is purely a result of my own experimentation with CNN techniques and hyperparameter tuning.

## Results
The results are reproduceable in Google Colab utilizing a T4 GPU runtime environment, but free tier usage limits may require training to be done over two days. My model classified the test set images with **89% accuracy** with similar results on the validation set. These results could improve with more data, greater compute capacity, or incorporation of a pretrained model.
